		<!--Describing my Interests and Experience in Coding-->
		<p> I was fortunate to be born and raised in the Kootenays. I always held a keen interest in video games, and during high school I
		enrolled in a computer programming course. This piqued my curiosity in coding. After completing a computer programming course at Selkirk College,
		I abandoned my initial plans of being a marine biologist and enrolled at TRU in the computing science program.
		<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
		I have been exploring the coding world for a few years which has led to me developing a number of Python Projects. 
		These include: Goldbach’s Conjecture, BEDMAS calculator, Tic Tac Toe, and Adventure Games, all of which can be found on GitHub (See Info Page).
		<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
		School has been a top priority for me and I have been able to achieve recognition for my hard work and dedication to my studies.
